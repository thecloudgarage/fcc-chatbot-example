# Chatbot example (updated for NodeJS v17.4)

This is a chatbot sample code built for an article on FreeCodeCamp. It's built using [react-chatbot-kit](https://github.com/FredrikOseberg/react-chatbot-kit).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. If yarn.lock is not downloaded, create a file yarn.lock and copy the contents of the yarn.lock in this repo
3. Node (v17) and Yarn should be installed
4. Run yarn install
5. Under parent directory export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider (due to some errors thrown by Node v17)
6. Run yarn start
7. Open the browser to localhost:3000
